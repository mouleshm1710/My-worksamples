Hi, I am very much glad to showcase some of my work samples on data science & machine learning and also assure you that these works are solely done by me.
I would like to thank the team at appliedAI course who motivated & guided me on solving these assignments whenever im stuck at some point. 

All these assignments cover a range of topics like 
1) EDA in Python(Haberman dataset)
2) Naive Bayes,Logistic regression,SVM implementation
3) Hyperparameter tuning in Python (Overfitting/underfitting)
4) Decision trees, Random forest, GBDT implementation
5) Naive Bayes algorithm implementation
6) Beautiful Soup Web Scraping
7) Various Performance metrics --> like Accuracy,F1score,AUC,Confusion matrix,Log loss etc.. 
8) NLP specific Text cleaning & Preprocessing, TFIDF,Word2vec,Word Cloud
9) Some Feature engineering stuffs
10) Clustering on graph dataset
11) Deep learning --> Backpropagation,Callbacks,Tensorboard
12) CNN & LSTM implementation
